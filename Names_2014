##I used data from Big Query which shows the most popular names for both boys and girls in 2014.##


##The first query simply shows the names that were used more than 1100 times in 2014.##
SELECT
  name
FROM
  `my-database-project-0-0.babynames.names_2014`
WHERE
  count > 1100;
  
##This query only shows the names that were registered as names for Males##
SELECT
  *
FROM
  `my-database-project-0-0.babynames.names_2014`
WHERE
  gender= "M";
  
##Query shows names that were registered for Males or any name that was registered more that 10,000 times.##
SELECT
  *
FROM
  `my-database-project-0-0.babynames.names_2014`
WHERE
  gender = "M"
  OR count > 10000;
  
##QUery shows names that were registered more that 15,000 times for either gender##
SELECT
  name
FROM
  `my-database-project-0-0.babynames.names_2014`
WHERE
  count > 15000;
  
##Query shows names that for either gender that begin with the letter "A"##
SELECT
  name
FROM
  `my-database-project-0-0.babynames.names_2014`
WHERE
  name LIKE 'A%';
  
##Final query shows names for either gender that either begin with or end with "A"##
SELECT
  name
FROM
  `my-database-project-0-0.babynames.names_2014`
WHERE
  name LIKE "A%"
  AND name LIKE "%a";
